### 문제 설명

<p>The animals are conspiring again. The cows are mooing very strangely and you’re certain of it. Your theory is that the length of each “MM” sound and the length of the “OO” sound can be translated to hexadecimal values and then converted to ascii. Create a program to translate cowspeak to English so you can find out what they’re up to.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line will contain a single integer n that indicates the number of data sets that follow. Each data set will consist of one line containing many space separated strings representing the cows’ moos.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output the decoded cowspeak</p>
